<%# app/views/quotes/create.turbo_stream.erb %>
<%# The first line tells Turbo to prepend to the Turbo Frame with id quotes the app/views/quotes/_quote.html.erb partial. As we can see, it's straightforward to pass a partial and locals to the turbo_stream helper.%>

<%= turbo_stream.prepend "quotes", @quote %>

<%# This can be written a few different ways %>
<%#= turbo_stream.prepend "quotes", partial: "quotes/quote", locals: { quote: @quote } %>

<%# or %>
<%#= turbo_stream.prepend "quotes" do %>
  <%#= render partial: "quotes/quote", locals: { quote: @quote } %>
<%# end %>

<%# or simply %>
<%#= turbo_stream.prepend "quotes" do %>
  <#%= render @quote %>
<#% end %>

<%# This next line tells Turbo to update the Turbo Frame with id new_quote with empty content.  %>
<%= turbo_stream.update Quote.new, "" %>
